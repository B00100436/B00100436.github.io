<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2><i>The story continues...</i></h2>
<p>Fionn was sad, for he feared that if Oisín went with Niamh, he would never see him again. But it was too late, Oisín was already in love with the princess. He accepted Niamh’s invitation and waving goodbye to Fionn and his friends, he jumped onto the horse behind Niamh. Away they galloped into the morning mist.</p>
<p>Over the land and the sea the fairy horse ran, moving as swiftly as a shadow. At last they reached the golden shores of Tír na nÓg. The king and queen welcomed Oisín and held a great feast in his honour. It was a magical land. Oisín hunted and feasted and at night he told stories of Fionn and the Fianna and of their lives in Ireland. Oisín had never felt as happy as he did with Niamh and before long they were married.</p>
<p>Oisín lived in Tír na nÓg for three hundred years, but being so happy, it only seemed like three. Then a great longing came on him to go back to Ireland. Niamh did not want him to go but at last she agreed and gave him the white horse. Niamh warned him “set foot, even once, on the soil of Ireland and you will never return to Tír na nÓg.”</p>
