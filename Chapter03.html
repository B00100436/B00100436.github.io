<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<h2><i>Almost there...can you wait for the ending...</i></h2>
<p>When Oisín reached Ireland he found that everything had changed. There was no trace of his father or the fianna. As he passed through Gleann na Smol, the valley of the thrushes, he saw a group of men trying to move a large stone. “I will help you” he said. The mighty Oisín stooped down in his saddle, and with one hand, lifted the stone. But as he did so, the saddle strap broke and he tumble to the ground. Immediately the fairy horse galloped away and a great change came over Oisín. In the blink of an eye the great hero of the Fianna became a withered old man.</p>
<p>oh no what happened then...</p>
<p>Unsure of what to do, legend has it that the men brought Oisín to Saint Patrick. Saint Patrick tried to comfort Oisín in his old age. When Oisín learned that the Fianna and his father were long since dead, his heart was filled with sadness. Oisín spoke of the old days of the fianna and the many great deeds of Fionn, when they hunted and feasted and listened to great stories. He spoke of his time in Tír na nÓg and his beautiful with Niamh. Although Oisín died soon after, the wonderful stories of Niamh and Oisín have lived on.</p>
